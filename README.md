# Post an Activity Method Implementation

Implemented the "Post an Activity" use case.

## Preconditions

- The user of the page is logged in as an Activity Organizer.
  - Since this was not in the scope of the method implemented, the default organizer is "Adamo".

## How to Use

- Click the "Post an Activity" button
- Fill in the modal form that appears
- Click "Submit"

The activity that was defined in the form should now be seen in the list of Planned Activities.

Other activities not planned by the logged-in activity organizer can be seen under "Available Activities".
